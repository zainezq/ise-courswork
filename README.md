# Tool Building Project - Configuration Performance Learning

This is the repository where the baseline model and the proposed solution are stored. This is for the tool building project, configuration performance learning (lab 2). In this repository you will find the datasets used, the `lab2_solution.py`, and the proposed solution `lab2-v1.py`. Furthermore you will find the test results outputted to a `.txt` file, named `output_base.txt` and `output_proposed.txt`. Finally you can also find the code used for the statistical analysis as well as the code for outputting them for the report.

## Requirements

To run the `lab2-v1.py` script, you will need to install the following dependencies:

### 1. Install Dependencies

You can install the required Python libraries by using `pip`. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### Running the Script

Once the dependencies are installed and the dataset is correctly set up, you can run the script using one of the following commands:

```bash
python lab2-v1.py
```

```bash
python3 lab2-v1.py
```
